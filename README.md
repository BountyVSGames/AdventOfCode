# Advent Of Code 2024

This is a repository of my work on the assignments of the Advent of Code 2024. Every single day from the 1st to the 25th of December 1 assignment would unlock to complete. Each assignment would give you a certain input from which you would need to solve a puzzle using your own code to generate a output that would need to be submitted. If correct, you would get a star, and it would unlock a second assignment, which requires you to adjust your previous code to generate a different output, which you could submit and if that output was correct you would get a second star.
