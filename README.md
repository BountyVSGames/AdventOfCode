# Advent Of Code

This is a repository of my work on the assignments of the Advent of Code. Every single day from the 1st to the 25th of December 1 assignment would unlock to complete. Each assignment would give you a certain input from which you would need to solve a puzzle using your own code to generate a output that would need to be submitted. If correct, you would get a star, and it would unlock a second assignment, which requires you to adjust your previous code to generate a different output, which you could submit and if that output was correct you would get a second star.

The challenge of advent of code has been going on since 2015, but so far I have only participated in these editions: 2023-2025.

The puzzle inputs are not included in this repo, as requested by the creator https://adventofcode.com/about#faq\_copying. If you would like to test any of the code implementation, please go on to the advent of code website and either login in or create a new account, get the input for that day, create a .txt file in the project folder, under "Input/" called Day + number of the day .txt. For example: "\\AdventOfCode24\\Input\\Day1.txt"
